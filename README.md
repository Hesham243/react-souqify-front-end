## 🕹️ Description

**Souqify** is a marketplace web application where users can create their own stores, add products, and interact with other sellers.  
Each store can have multiple items, and any signed-in user can leave reviews on items.  
We built Souqify to provide a collaborative, community-driven online shopping experience.
