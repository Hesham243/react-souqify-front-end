## üìù Project Description

**Souqify** is a marketplace web application where users can create their own stores, add products, and interact with other sellers.  
Each store can have multiple items, and any signed-in user can leave reviews on items.  
We built Souqify to provide a collaborative, community-driven online shopping experience.

This project was developed as part of a **MERN Stack full-stack development requirement**:

- **Frontend:** React for a dynamic, interactive UI.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for server-side functionality.
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage and management.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented on both frontend and backend using JWT.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full create, read, update, and delete functionality for users, stores, items, and reviews.
- **Deployment:** Frontend deployed to **Vercel**, backend deployed to **Heroku**.
- **Planning:** Created ERD, user stories, and wireframes before development.
